# Firebase Storage Fixes - Summary

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Critical Bug in AdminBlogManager.jsx ✅
**Problem**: Line 97 was trying to use a full Firebase Storage URL as a storage reference path, which is invalid.

**Solution**: 
- Removed the incorrect `ref(storage, 'full-url')` usage
- Fixed avatar handling by using the URL directly
- Added proper error handling

### 2. Firebase Rules Management ✅
**Problem**: Local rule files conflicting with console management requirement.

**Solution**:
- Deleted `storage.rules` file
- Deleted `firestore.rules` file  
- Deleted `firestore.indexes.json` file
- Updated `firebase.json` to remove rule file references
- All rules now managed through Firebase Console

### 3. Enhanced Error Handling ✅
**Problem**: Poor error handling in upload functions made debugging difficult.

**Solution**:
- Added try-catch blocks to all upload functions
- Added detailed error logging with `console.error`
- Added descriptive error messages for users

### 4. File Name Sanitization ✅
**Problem**: File names with special characters could cause upload issues.

**Solution**:
- Added filename sanitization in all upload functions
- Replace special characters with underscores
- Maintains file extensions properly

rules_version = '2';
service firebase.storage {
  match /b/{bucket}/o {
